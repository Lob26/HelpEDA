In the land of San Domingo
Lived a girl called Oh By Jingo
From the fields and from the marshes
Came the young and oh by goshes
They all spoke with a different lingo
But they all loved Oh By Jingo
And every night
They sang in the pale moonlight
Oh By Gee, By Gosh, By Gum, By Jove
Oh By Jingo, won't you hear our love?
We will build for you a hut
You will be our favorite nut
We will have a lot of little oh By Gollies
And we'll put them in the follies
By Jingo said, â€½By Gosh, By Gee
By Jiminy, please don't bother meâ€
So they all went away singing
Oh By Gee, By Gosh, By Gum, By Jove, By Jingo
By Gee, you're the only girl for me
Oh By Gee, By Gosh, By Gum, By Jove
Oh By Jingo, won't you hear our love?
We will build for you a hut
You will be our favorite nut
We will have a lot of little oh By Gollies
And we'll put them in the follies
By Jingo said, â€½By Gosh, By Gee
By Jiminy, please don't bother meâ€
So they all went away singing
Oh By Gee, By Gosh, By Gum, By Jove, By Jingo
By Gee, you're the only girl for me
